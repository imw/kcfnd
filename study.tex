\section{Study Results}\label{LPA}


%
\subsection{Requirements}
-scope -coverage -performance -cost -reliability
-two ptp links to existing infrastructure
-one square mile
-best effort coverage
-reasonable expectation of 3mbps


\subsection{Survey Information}
-terrain
-rf environment


\subsection{Findings}
-list of possible tower sites ranked by utility estimation
-general cost estimate
-specific requirements for initial tower
-number of participants per node/relay/tower
-number of nodes/relays/towers per area
-variables/risks
-overview of how lincoln network would be built, general size, very loose
estimates of performance. 

\subsection{Risks}
1-. the promoter stops funding the project\\
-- for the project: all the work already done to the trash can\\
-- for the CNs: bad reputation since is what the end user sees\\


\subsection{Recommendations}

risk 1-. to avoid the risks detected\\
-- ownership to the end user (following the current approach)\\
