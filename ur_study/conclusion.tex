\section{Conclusion}
Few would argue with the idea that connectivity creates opportunity. The 
real challenge lies in figuring out how to fight for access in a way 
that is both sustainable and effective. We believe that the key to 
success lies not in technology alone, but in technology and education 
enabling communities to invest in themselves. \par

By stewarding the emergence of a network with no single owner or operator, 
we can help make sure that Kansas City's core doesn't depend
on budget policy or grant funding just to get online. The Network
Commons License provides a framework for building just such a network. \par

We urge you to examine the NCL, and ask you to consider the ideas and
proposals in this document. We know that they are not exactly
conventional, but they have proven themselves effective time and again. \par

Together, we have the opportunity to demonstrate a powerful new model
for digital inclusion and profoundly impact the future of our community,
our city, and our society. \par
