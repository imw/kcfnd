\subsection{Objectives}
In order to assess the feasbility of extending the KCFN to the Swope Corridor,
it is essential to define well-established targets for any potential work. The
proposal that follows is intended to satisfy the following parameters:
\begin{description}
\item[Purpose] This proposal is for a project intended to improve the state of
connectvity for businesses and residents within the Swope Corridor, establish
the Mary Kelley Center as a local hub for connectivity and digital skills
education, and demonstrate an organizing model that can be replicated in other
 communities.
\item[Scope] The geographical area under consideration is bounded by Volker
Boulevard and Swope Parkway on the North, Swope Parkway/Cleveland Street
on the East, 63\textsuperscript{rd} Street on the South, and The Paseo on the West
\em a total area of 7km\textsuperscript{2}. In addition to The Upper Room, it 
should involve an array of area residents, businesses, non-profits, and community groups.
\item[Coverage] Outside of bringing a cost-effective ultra-broadband connection
to the Kelly Center, the paramount concern is improving the availability of 
affordable residential Internet service for those within the designated geographic
scope. While it isn't possible to guarantee coverage to \%100 of residences with a community network approach,
our objective should be to allow any and all blocks within the area to participate. This
will not be possible without significant investment and involvement from within the
community itself.
\item[Functionality] Those that elect to participate in the network, in addition
to gaining access to resouces published on the KCFN, should have the
ability to purchase low-cost Internet access. 
\item[Performance] While exact performance figures will depend case-by-case on a
number of factors, the KCFN should enable broadband connectivity capable of supporting
telephony, web 2.0, and multimedia applications.
\item[Cost] The total cost of
accessing the Internet via the KCFN, including hardware, should be lower than existing
alternatives over the course of one year.
\item[Sustainibility] Above all, this effort should aim to foster a digital commons
that is sustainable in the long term --- focusing first and foremost on education, grassroots
support, and the capacity for ongoing, organic growth.

\subsection{Survey Information}
The primary physical considerations in determining build feasibility and an
appropriate course of action are topographic terrain and RF environment. We
surveyed the target area in October and November of 2013, analyzing the lay of land
and performing spectrum analysis. \par
\subsubsection{Terrain}
The terrain in question presents certain significant challenges to network
deployment.
