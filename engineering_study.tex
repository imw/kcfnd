\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}
\subsection{The Network Commons or Free Vs. Proprietary Networks}
-A local/metropolitan network
-ability to interconnect with other networks
-ability to interconnect with global networks
-ability to interconnect with other local networks
-ability to offer services
-ability to tunnel.
-No local transit costs due to stakeholdership

\subsection{Wireless Communications}
-Inexpensive
-Lossy
-Licensed/unlicensed bands
--microwave
--higher frequencies


\section{Network Architecture}\label{Architecture}
\subsection{KCFN Architecture}
\subsection{LPA Cloud}

\section{Physical Infrastructure}\label{previous work}
A much longer \LaTeXe{} example was written by Gil~\cite{Gil:02}.

\section{RF Environment}\label{results}
In this section we describe the results.


\section{Variables}\label{conclusions}
We worked hard, and achieved very little.

\section{Costs}\label{costs}
How much it will costs, what devices cost, table of costs.
